Don't restrain yourself to just black & white! Change the visualization's style, size, color (modifier and normal keys), border, icon, and symbols.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Fully Customizable

Powerful and easy to use configuration options. 
- Filter normal keys and only display shortcuts like <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>S</kbd>
